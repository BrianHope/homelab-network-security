# Homelab Network Security

This repository documents my homelab setup, network security experiments, and findings as I build and test network defense strategies using OPNsense, Ubuntu VMs, and various security tools.

## Contents

- `notes/` — Lab findings and documentation
- `scripts/` — Scripts and automation tools (planned)
- `diagrams/` — Network architecture diagrams (planned)

## Lab Findings

- [Lab Finding #1: Why OPNsense Could Not Block the SSH Brute Force Attack](notes/Lab_Finding_1_OPNsense_SSH_Brute_Force.md)


## Tools & Technologies

- OPNsense firewall
- VirtualBox
- Ubuntu Linux
- Hydra, Nmap, tcpdump
- Python, Bash

## Next Steps

- Implement segmented LAN/VLAN design
- Apply firewall rules to segmented networks
- Document additional attack/defense scenarios
